# Python-Learning
Repository for all my python codes.

Address Book - My first code in python. It is done by setting variables for everyone's name, whether they have a license or not, their age, their grade, and their email. It is then all converted into strings and outputted using print().

Group Randomizer - My second program. This one is a tad more advanced -- utilizing loops, lists, and the random module. it takes in a user input of either 2, 3, or 4, then it takes in student exceptions (i.e. two students who can't be together). when shuffling the students, if the exceptions are in the same group, it'll reshuffle until the exceptions are accounted for.
